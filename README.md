### SIEM
- Security information and event management (SIEM) is a security management system that combines security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) functions that  helps improve security awareness and identify security threats and risks. It collects information from various security devices, monitors and analyzes this information, and then presents the results in a manner that is relevant to the enterprise using it.

## Patching  
- A security patch is an update that often comes from a security developer to any device that needs the update. Delayed patch updates often come because a vulnerability or hole isn’t known or discovered before the software is released initially or before a big update is rolled out.A security patch covers the holes in security that initially weren’t covered.
