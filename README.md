# Cybersecurity
## What is Cybersecurity?  
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from cyberattacks.  
Cyberattacks can be aimed at:  
- Accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information
- Extorting money from users via ransomware
- Interrupting normal business processes

- Unauthorised modification - In cyber security, unauthorized modification is the act of accessing information without permission. It can involve altering the physical or logical nature of a computer or network without knowledge that it is reckless and negligent.  
- Unauthorised deletion - Unauthorized deletion is the process of removing information from an information system without authorization. It's considered a breach of integrity because deletion is a type of modification.  
- Unauthorised access - Unauthorized access is when someone gains access to a system, network, application, data, or device without permission. It's also known as "hacking".

## Patching  
- A security patch is an update that often comes from a security developer to any device that needs the update. Delayed patch updates often come because a vulnerability or hole isn’t known or discovered before the software is released initially or before a big update is rolled out.A security patch covers the holes in security that initially weren’t covered.

- An IP address is a unique number that identifies a host or interface in a network. A subnet mask is a 32-bit combination that splits an IP address into two parts
- Host: One part of the IP address identifies the host, or computer.
- Network: The other part of the IP address identifies the network to which the host belongs.
- Subnet masks are structured like IP addresses, but they show the start of the host number. They identify the range of IP addresses that make up a subnet, or group of IP addresses on the same network

- Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) is a conceptual framework that defines how networking systems communicate and send data.
- *Wireshark*-Wireshark is a free, open-source tool that analyzes network traffic in real-time. It can capture data packets from a network connection, such as Ethernet, Bluetooth, wireless, token ring, and frame relay connections. Wireshark translates that data into information for IT professionals and cybersecurity teams
  
## Addressing modes
- Addressing modes are how you addresss a packet to its destination

1.*Unicast*
- When there is TCP/IP protocol red and blue computers can talk simulataneously whereas when there is UDP only one computer can send strea(i.e red to blue or vice versa) and after one finishes communicating next computer can start communicating.

- MD5 and SHA1 are both hashing algorithms. MD5 stands for Message Digest, while SHA1 stands for Secure Hash Algorithm. MD5 generates a message digest of 128-bits, while SHA1 generates a message digest of 160-bit hash value. 

## TLS(Transport Layer security) and SSL(Secure socker layer)   
- *TLS*-It is a security protocol that encrypts communication between web applications and servers over the internet. TLS uses both symmetric encryption and public key encryption to securely send private data. It also adds additional security features, such as authentication and message tampering detection.

<img width="750" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-17 145958" src="https://github.com/raunakkk21/Cybersecurity/assets/143111163/dce97c86-fde2-46c2-881e-527cb17beb6e">

- *SSL*- It's a security protocol that encrypts, secures, and authenticates communications on the internet.SSL was developed in 1995 by Netscape to ensure privacy, authentication, and data integrity in internet communications. It's the predecessor to the modern TLS encryption used today.Netscape eventually spun off their source code and become mozilla project.
