# Cybersecurity
## What is Cybersecurity?  
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from cyberattacks.  
Cyberattacks can be aimed at:  
- Accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information
- Extorting money from users via ransomware
- Interrupting normal business processes

- Unauthorised modification - In cyber security, unauthorized modification is the act of accessing information without permission. It can involve altering the physical or logical nature of a computer or network without knowledge that it is reckless and negligent.  
- Unauthorised deletion - Unauthorized deletion is the process of removing information from an information system without authorization. It's considered a breach of integrity because deletion is a type of modification.  
- Unauthorised access - Unauthorized access is when someone gains access to a system, network, application, data, or device without permission. It's also known as "hacking".

### SIEM
- Security information and event management (SIEM) is a security management system that combines security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) functions that  helps improve security awareness and identify security threats and risks. It collects information from various security devices, monitors and analyzes this information, and then presents the results in a manner that is relevant to the enterprise using it.

## Patching  
- A security patch is an update that often comes from a security developer to any device that needs the update. Delayed patch updates often come because a vulnerability or hole isn’t known or discovered before the software is released initially or before a big update is rolled out.A security patch covers the holes in security that initially weren’t covered.

- **DoS(Denial of Service)**-A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is a type of cyber attack in which a malicious actor aims to render a computer or other device unavailable to its intended users by interrupting the device's normal functioning.

- **DDoS(Domain name system amplification attack)**-A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a cybercriminal's attempt to overwhelm a server's infrastructure by flooding it with traffic. This can cause a site to slow down or crash, preventing legitimate traffic from reaching it.

- *TFN(Tribe Flood Network)*- It is a set of computer programs to conduct various DDoS attack.Such as ICMP flood,SYN flood, UDP flood and Smurf attack


## Penetration Testing

- *Goals of penetration testing*  
   - Assesing the weakness in an organisation security posture
   - Understanding risk postions better
   - Acessesing systems to find weaknesses before external expoloits

## Footprinting

- *Wayback machine(can be used for footprinting)*-The Wayback Machine is a service which can be used to cite archived copies of web pages used by articles. This is useful if a web page has changed, moved, or disappeared; links to the original content can be retained.i.e arhieve.org
- *Netcraft*-Netcraft's online brand protection operates 24/7 to discover phishing, fraud, scams, and cyber attacks through extensive automation, AI, machine learning, and human insight. Their disruption & takedown service ensures that malicious content is blocked and removed quickly and efficiently—typically within hours.
- *ARIN(American registry for internet)*-The American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) is the regional Internet registry for the United States, Canada, and many Caribbean and North Atlantic islands. ARIN manages the distribution of Internet number resources, including IPv4 and IPv6 address space and AS numbers.

### Hostname resolution
- Host name resolution resolves the names of TCP/IP resources that do not connect through the NetBIOS interface. The most common example of this is a Web browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer. Other examples include Internet applications such as Ping, FTP, and Telnet.
- *NetBIOS interface(Network Basic Input/Output System)*-It is a network service that enables applications on different computers to communicate with each other across a local area network (LAN).
