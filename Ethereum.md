- *Ethereum Nodes*
   - *Full Node*
      - Stores copy of entire blockchain
      - Verfies and validates the block
   - *Light Node*
      - Stores only the block header, depends on full node
      - For low capacity devices which cannot afford to store gigabytes of data
   - *Archive Node*
      - Stores everything kept in the full node and built an archieve of historical data
      - Requires terabytes of space
     
### *Ethereum Accounts*
- It is an entity with an ether(ETH) balance that can send or receive transactions on Ethereum
- An EOA is controlled by a private key, has no associated code, and can send transactions.
- A contract account has an associated code that executes when it receives a transaction from an EOA
- Smart contract is a program that runs on ethereum blockchain
- Bitcoin is made by Bitcoin script(No turing complete-Loops cannot be used)
- Ethereum is made by solidity(Turing complete-We can execute any code according to our logic,loops are present)
- Each node has following:
   - Currrent state of all smart contracts
   - History of both transaction and smart contract
