# *Ethereum*
- Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source platform that uses blockchain technology to create a permanent, tamper-proof record of transactions.

- *Ethereum Nodes*
   - *Full Node*
      - Stores copy of entire blockchain
      - Verfies and validates the block
   - *Light Node*
      - Stores only the block header, depends on full node
      - For low capacity devices which cannot afford to store gigabytes of data
   - *Archive Node*
      - Stores everything kept in the full node and built an archieve of historical data
      - Requires terabytes of space
     
### *Ethereum Accounts*
- It is an entity with an ether(ETH) balance that can send or receive transactions on Ethereum
- An EOA is controlled by a private key, has no associated code, and can send transactions.
- A contract account has an associated code that executes when it receives a transaction from an EOA
- Smart contract is a program that runs on ethereum blockchain
- Bitcoin is made by Bitcoin script(No turing complete-Loops cannot be used)
- Ethereum is made by solidity(Turing complete-We can execute any code according to our logic,loops are present)
- Each node has following:
   - Currrent state of all smart contracts
   - History of both transaction and smart contract

### *Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM)*  
- It is designed as the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It is sandboxed and isolated from the other parts of the system. This means that any operation on EVM should not affect your data or programs in any way, no matter how many times you call a particular function on it.

### *Ethereum Gas*

- Find more info at "https://github.com/djrtwo/evm-opcode-gas-costs"
- Any transaction that modifies the blockchain costs gas
- The user that generated the transaction pays for the gas
- The higher tha gas price, the faster the transaction will be mined
- Gas limit can prevent cyberattacks by limiting use of gas

### *The DAO Attack* 
- DAO attack was due to a bug in smart contract which ran over ethereum blockchain

- After DAO attack, due to hard fork ethereum blockchain was divide into ethereum classic and ethereum
