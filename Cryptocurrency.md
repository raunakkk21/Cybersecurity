-  Coins are any cryptocurrency that has a standalone independent blockchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Rippleâ€¦)
-  Tokens are digital assets that operate on an existing blockchain network instead of on their own. This gives them some interesting properties relating to interoperability.

### *How Mining Works:The Nonce*  
- It is a random number that bitcoin miners try to find in order to mine a new block in the Bitcoin blockchain and receive a block reward for their efforts.

- Target value changes every two weeks which leads to increasing or decreasing difficulty levels.

### *Mining Pools*    
- A mining pool is a group of cryptocurrency miners who connect their mining machines over a network to increase their chances of earning rewards.
- Rewards are given according to their use of  hashing power
- Each miner computer work on different problems to optimize their hasing power

- All the nonces will be exhausted in only 40 seconds and remaining hashes never hit the target which will create a problem, which leads us to a new concept called Timestamp



### *Timestamp*    
- In each second as the time changes hash value also changes due to avlanche effect(unix time).
- But in every 1 second miner can only use 0.1 billion nonce in 1 second after which timestamp changes which results in change of hash value
- As the hash value changes, the nonces that we used can be used once again and can be utilised according to machine efficiency at current time
- And nonces can be used again and again

- But if we see in whole network the nonces exhaust in a very less period of time which is far less than 1 second


  
----------    

###  *Mempool*    
- A mempool is a temporary storage area for transactions in a cryptocurrency network
- Miners take any number of transactions and keep in their ledger
- When nonces get over in a very less time, then the miners change the transaction to slight smaller values which change the hash value and nonces which got exhausted can be used once again.
- After this timstamp again changes and  this cycle repeats again.

### *Transactions and UTXOs(Unspent transaction output)*  
- When a Bitcoin transaction takes place, it creates one or more outputs, which are essentially the destination addresses where the Bitcoins are being sent. These outputs are assigned a value, which is the amount of Bitcoins being transferred.

- Finaaly we are left with bob's UTXO

- Wallet fetches UTXOs and then calculates how much balance are we left with.
