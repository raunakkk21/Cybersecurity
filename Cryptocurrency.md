### *Mining Pools*    
- A mining pool is a group of cryptocurrency miners who connect their mining machines over a network to increase their chances of earning rewards.
- Rewards are given according to their use of  hashing power
- Each miner computer work on different problems to optimize their hasing power

- All the nonces will be exhausted in only 40 seconds and remaining hashes never hit the target which will create a problem, which leads us to a new concept called Timestamp
