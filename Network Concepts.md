## Topology
- Network topology is the physical and logical arrangement of nodes and connections in a network. It can be depicted physically or logically

### *Types of topology*

- Data can be only sent or received at a time

## Network Addressing
- *MAC Address*-A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a 12-character alphanumeric(hexadecimal) code that uniquely identifies a device on a network. It's also known as a physical address, hardware address, or burned-in address (BIA).
    - Use command *GETMAC* in cmd to get details about MAC address
    - The Block ID is the first six characters of a MAC address. The Device ID is the remaining six characters.
    - We can check details about  mac address by some sites like dnchecker.org or macvendors.com
- *IP address*

  - *Class D & E* IP  address is an IP address not assigned to individual hosts but rather used for multicasting.
  - *Loopback address*-A loopback address is a special IP address that allows a computer's ethernet network to send information to itself using the TCP/IP stack. It's also known as localhost.
  - Static and dynamic IP-When a device is assigned a static IP address, the address does not change. Most devices use dynamic IP addresses, which are assigned by the network when they connect and change over time.

- A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a complete address for a computer, server, or website on the internet. It is made up of three parts:  

- Hostname
- Domain name
- Top-level domain (TLD)-final part of domain name following the last dot
