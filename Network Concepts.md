## Network Addressing
- *MAC Address*-A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a 12-character alphanumeric(hexadecimal) code that uniquely identifies a device on a network. It's also known as a physical address, hardware address, or burned-in address (BIA).
    - Use command *GETMAC* in cmd to get details about MAC address
    - The Block ID is the first six characters of a MAC address. The Device ID is the remaining six characters.
    - We can check details about  mac address by some sites like dnchecker.org or macvendors.com
